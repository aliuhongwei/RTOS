/******************************************************************************
 * NOTE 1:  This project provides three demo applications.  A simple blinky
 * style project, a more comprehensive test and demo application, and an
 * lwIP example.  The mainSELECTED_APPLICATION setting in main.c is used to
 * select between the three.  See the notes on using mainSELECTED_APPLICATION
 * in main.c.  This file implements the comprehensive version.
 *
 * NOTE 2:  This file only contains the source code that is specific to the
 * full demo.  Generic functions, such FreeRTOS hook functions, and functions
 * required to configure the hardware, are defined in main.c.
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * main_full() creates all the demo application tasks and software timers, then
 * starts the scheduler.  The web documentation provides more details of the
 * standard demo application tasks, which provide no particular functionality,
 * but do provide a good example of how to use the FreeRTOS API.
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * FreeRTOS+CLI command console.  The command console is access through the
 * UART to USB connector on the ZC702 Zynq development board (marked J2).  For
 * reasons of robustness testing the UART driver is deliberately written to be
 * inefficient and should not be used as a template for a production driver.
 * Type "help" to see a list of registered commands.  The FreeRTOS+CLI license
 * is different to the FreeRTOS license, see http://www.FreeRTOS.org/cli for
 * license and usage details.  The default baud rate is 115200.
 *
 * "Reg test" tasks - These fill both the core and floating point registers with
 * known values, then check that each register maintains its expected value for
 * the lifetime of the task.  Each task uses a different set of values.  The reg
 * test tasks execute with a very low priority, so get preempted very
 * frequently.  A register containing an unexpected value is indicative of an
 * error in the context switching mechanism.
 *
 * "Check" task - The check task period is initially set to three seconds.  The
 * task checks that all the standard demo tasks, and the register check tasks,
 * are not only still executing, but are executing without reporting any errors.
 * If the check task discovers that a task has either stalled, or reported an
 * error, then it changes its own execution period from the initial three
 * seconds, to just 200ms.  The check task also toggles an LED each time it is
 * called.  This provides a visual indication of the system status:  If the LED
 * toggles every three seconds, then no issues have been discovered.  If the LED
 * toggles every 200ms, then an issue has been discovered with at least one
 * task.
