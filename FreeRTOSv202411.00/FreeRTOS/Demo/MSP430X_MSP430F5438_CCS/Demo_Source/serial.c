/* BASIC INTERRUPT DRIVEN SERIAL PORT DRIVER.
 *
 * This is not a proper UART driver.  It only supports one port, uses loopback
 * mode, and is used to test interrupts that use the FreeRTOS API as part of 
 * a wider test suite.  Nor is it intended to show an efficient implementation
 * of a UART interrupt service routine as queues are used to pass individual
 * characters one at a time!
